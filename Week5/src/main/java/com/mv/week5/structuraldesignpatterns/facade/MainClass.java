    // Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library,
    // a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

    // Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that
    // belong to a sophisticated library or framework.
    // Ordinarily, youâ€™d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies,
    // execute methods in the correct order, and so on.
    // As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled
    // to the implementation details of 3rd-party classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain.

    // Example : Token Service, Encryption & Decryption service.

    //  It includes only those features that clients really care about.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TokenService tokenService = new JwtTokenService();
        SignInService signInService = new SignInService(tokenService);
        System.out.println(signInService.userLogin("username", "password"));
